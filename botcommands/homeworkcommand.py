"""
Assignment has an assigner (tutor), name (identifier), description (message ID), a solution (message ID).
It also has whether to tell the solution right after submission (in DM) or the date/time to tell the solution after
submission (after which it would be deleted).
Assignments will be created in DM and the assigner need only to edit the message directly to change them.
Assignments will be submitted based on tutor and name.
On submission, the student only need to use the assigner and the name and it will let the player know the description.
