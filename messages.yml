        **Welcome!** Roblox Development Academy is a school and community for game developers at any point in their
        journey. It's a school for any aspect of development, from scripting to art to audio engineering.
        You can consider us your beginning, the next step in your learning, or another home you can return to any time
        you need support, shelter, or companionship. You can even stay a while and help teach the next generation of
        developers. No matter your dreams, goals, and aspirations, RDA is here for you! %emoji.happy%
    - file: "web/static/info_discord/RDA Classes.png"
    - content: >
        Our custom bot, Headmaster (me :D), provides a system for teachers to schedule and host classes. You may see
        the scheduled classes and their times in %classes_channel%.


        If you are an experienced developer, we invite you to teach here at RDA and share your knowledge with students
        of your own! You can use the `.apply` command in the %commands_channel% to apply for the teacher role. Teachers
        can use the `.class` command to schedule a class. Headmaster (don't mind me talking about myself in third person)
        provides a text channel/optional voice channel or a one-click setup classroom server template to open your own
        classroom Discord server. `.help` offers a full list of all Headmaster's commands.
    - file: "web/static/info_discord/RDA Assignments.png"
    - content: >
        Headmaster also provides an assignments system where anyone can create their own assignment for anyone to
        submit. You can also schedule an assignment solution to be sent to all submitters immediately after submitting,
        at a certain date, or a specified time after submission.


        Use the `.hw` command to create or submit an assignment. `.help` offers a full list of all Headmaster's
        commands.
    - file: "web/static/info_discord/RDA Levels.png"
    - content: >
        Headmaster has a levels and leaderboards system based around helping others with their development. If someone
        finds the solution to your problem, you can react to their message with the %emoji.solution% emoji to give
        them level experience. Please only do this once per problem.


        You can view your own or others' level and rank in each of the development categories with `.profile`, view the
        entire leaderboard with `.leaderboard`, and have me politely remind others to mark solutions with `.remind`.
        `.help` offers a full list of all Headmaster's commands.

            Use `%prefix%multiplier <user> <multiplier> <duration (optional)>` to give **<user>** a multiplier of **<multiplier>**.
            If a duration is given, the temporary multiplier will last **<duration>** from when the command is executed.
